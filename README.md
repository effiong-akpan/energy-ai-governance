# Energy AI Governance

## Overview
This repository documents my transition from energy systems engineering into applied AI and data engineering, with a focus on governance-first design.

The goal of this project is to build reproducible, auditable, and technically sound AI workflows for energy-sector applications including biomass, power systems, and infrastructure analytics.

This is not a tutorial repo. It is an engineering log.

## Why This Project Exists
Most AI projects fail in regulated industries because they:
- Lack data lineage
- Are not reproducible
- Ignore governance until late stages
- Cannot be audited or deployed safely

This repository addresses those failures from Day 1.

---

## Technical Scope
Planned components include:
- Structured data pipelines
- Energy-focused datasets
- Exploratory data analysis
- Regression and forecasting models
- Governance artifacts (lineage, assumptions, constraints)
- Documentation-first development

## Engineering Principles
- Reproducibility over speed
- Explicit assumptions
- Versioned dependencies
- Clean commit history
- Governance before optimization

## Status
Day 1 — Project initialization complete.  
No models implemented yet.
